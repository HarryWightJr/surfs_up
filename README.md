# Surfs Up Analysis
## Overview
While working on temperature data for the town of Oahu, HI our clients, Mr. W. Avy, asked us to specifically find data on the months of June and December.He is looking to open a sruf and ice cream shop in the town and would like to know if the temperature in Oahu will be conducive for a business venture such as that. Using data proved from observation stations around that area we wer able to determine the summary statistics for those two months to give Mr. Wavy a better idea of what may be ahead of him if he goes through with this start up.

### June Temperature Analysis
    * All data can be seen on a table in the Resources folder on the file named "june_df_describe".
    * June's maximum temperature was recorded as 85 degrees fahrenheit and the minimum was 64 degrees fahrenhieght. 
    * Looking at the 25, 50, and 75 percentile we can see that most temperature fall between 73 and 77 degrees, respectfully. The mean temperature was 74.94 degrees fahrenheit, right along with our 50 percentile.
    * With a standard deviation of 3.257 we can make an educated guess that the minimum and maximum temperatures are outliers rather than usually temperatures.

### December temperature Analysis
    * All data can be seen on a table in the Resources folder on the file named "dec_df_describe".
    * December's maximum was simialr to June's with 83 degrees fahrenheit. However, the minimum, 56 degrees fahrenheit, was noticably lower than June's.
    * The 25, 50, and 75 percentile were, again, fairly consistent with 69, 71, and 74 degrees fahrenheit, respectfully. The standard deviation was simialr to June's as well with a 3.746 standard devaition.
    * Once more we can make an educated guess that the minimum and maximum are more outliers than constants.

#### Take Aways
What we can take away from this analysis is that even in the colder months Mr. W. Avy is still looking at the lowest temperature of 56 degrees fahrenheit. The constant temperatures throughout the year appear to stay in between 69 and 77 degrees fahrenheit. With this information we can advise Mr. Avy to go through with this start up as the temperature will permit year long surfing and ice cream sales.
